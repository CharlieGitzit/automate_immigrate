# automate_immigrate

This is a personal project to explore what life is like "without VScode"

Observation: 
    cursor pointer while entering VScode wasn't scaling correctly making it difficult to navigate work environment

Action:
     uninstalled VScode and config files

Take-Aways: 
    my environment and use cases are capable with Vim & CLI

NOTES: 

Initially I was unaware that this change of environment could create  such opportunity. Upon initial discovery I felt losing VScode
meant my workflow was ruined and could no longer fulfill future projects for practice & experimentation. Moving forward with
Vim as the primary IDE and CLI to continue on the course I had been on.
